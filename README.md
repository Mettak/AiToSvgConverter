# AiToSvgConverter
Simple console application for convert Adobe Photoshop's paths from Adobe Illustrator file (.ai) to Scalable Vector Graphics file (.svg)

## Why?
If you are for some reason using older version of Adobe Photoshop (CS6 or older) you are probably may have asked yourself a question: "How can I export my paths from Photoshop to SVG without Adobe Illustrator?". If you have, this could be something for you.

## Example

Let's create some path in Photoshop:

Then, we'll save it with Export -> Paths to Illustrator button:

Last but not least, we'll use this magical command:

And voil√†, here is our SVG!
